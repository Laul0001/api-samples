This is a sample spring-boot application that connects to the Payments Canada API, gets a bearer token, and makes an API request to fetch a branch-sandbox item.

This is to be used as a guide only, and is NOT production ready code. Values (consumer_key + secret), (dprn) will need to be replaced. For more information, visit https://developer.payments.ca/getting-started
